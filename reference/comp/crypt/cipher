### Symmetric ###
* DES (Data Encryption Standard): BROKEN, 56-bit key
* 3DES: 3*56-bit keys, but effective key length is only
  2*56 = 112bit due to meet-in-the-middle attack.
  ciphertext=Encr(Decr(Encr(plaintext))) using DES
* AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)/Rijndael: 128/192/256-bit
  key, 128-bit block size

### Public Key Crypto ###
* Diffie-Hellman: establish shared secret over insecure connection
  Vulnerable to MITM, requiring additional authentification
* RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Aldeman): BROKEN with keysize <768bit.
  Based on factoring of large integers, vulnerable to shor algo
* ElGamal: Based on DH
* DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm): relies on the entropy,
  secrecy, and uniqueness of the random signature value!

### Other ###
RC4 (ARCFOUR): BROKEN
