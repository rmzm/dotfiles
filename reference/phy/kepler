== Kepler's laws of planetary motion ==
1. The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci
2. A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during
   equal amounts of time
3. The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the
   cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit
