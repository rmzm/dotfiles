- Plasma membrane: Single phospholipid bilayer enclosing the cell.
- Nucleus[1]: Membrane-bound container of DNA
  - Nucleolus[n]: Nonmembranous structure synthesizing ribosomal RNA and
    assembling it into ribosomes.  A nucleus has >=1 nucleoli.
  - Nuclear envelope: Double phospholipid bilayer membrane enclosing the
    nucleus. Perforated with pores. Continuous with ER.
  - Chromatin: DNA-Protein-Mush, visible as chromosomes during cell division.
- Endoplasmatic Reticulum[1]: network of membranous sacs and tubes, continuous
  with the nuclear envelope, involved in membrane synthesis
    - Smooth: Synthesizes lipids, membrane, steroids.  Enzymes here help to
      detoxify the cell from drugs -> involved in drug tolerance.  Stores Ca^2+
    - Rough: Attached ribosomes which synthesize proteins that are guided into
      the ER tubules for folding and guided to the transitional ER for export.
      All the membrane proteins for endomembrane use and secretory proteins are
      synthesized here.
    - Transitional ER: wraps secretory proteins into vesicles
- Ribosomes[LOTS]: small, spherical complexes that make proteins.
  Free in cytosol or bound to rough ER or nuclear envelope.
- Golgi Apparatus[1]: Modifies, sorts, envelops and secretes cell products.
  Organized into stacks of 40~100 flat membranous sacs (cisternae) which are
  connected in mammals and independent in plants.  Yeast have >1 Golgi.
- Mitochondria[1~?k]: Powerhouses of the cell that generates ATP. w/ bacterial
  heritage and own set of genes.  Enclosed in two phospholipid bilayers.
  Forms a dynamic, branched, tubular network inside the cell.
- Lysosome[n]: Digestive organelle where macromolecules are hydrolyzed
- Centrosome[0-1]: Pair of centrioles, place where microtubules are initiated
- Cytoskeleton: Network of fibers that organizes structures and activities,
  consisting of Microtubules(25nm), Microfilaments (2 intertwined strands of
  actin, 7nm), Fibrous Proteins (e.g. keratins, 8-12nm).
  Actin gives the outer cytoplasmic layer (cortex) a gel-like consistency.
- Peroxisome: Organelle that catabolizes or detoxifies by removing H from
  substrates, binding it to O2 to form Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), then Water.
- Cilia[n]: Microtubule-containing extensions that project from some cells.
  Often motile.  Most vertebrate cells have 1 signal-receiving cilium called
  Primary Cilium.
