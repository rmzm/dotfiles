Rings of lamellae cause the top of the sensory neuron to bend
→ lamellae leak Na+ ions into the neuron
→ increases the generator potential to the threshold at first node of ranvier
→ neuron fires

As the lamellae adapt, continuous pressure doesn't cause the corpuscle to leak
more Na+, resulting in a negative feedback
