1. Adenylate Cyclase catalyzes ATP → cAMP + HP2O7.
2. Activates calcium channels
    → influx of Ca2+ ions at presynaptic terminals
    → initiates neurotransmitter exocytosis
3. Binds to PKA (protein kinase A, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase)
    → activates its PKA's catalytic subunits
    → enables them to phosphorylate substrate proteins
    → negative feedback by activating phosphodiesterase that converts cAMP→AMP
    → affects exposed Arg-Arg-X-Ser chains
    → effect depends on protein expression of the current location.
      In general, it stimulates excretion or production of something
4. Promotes
    - Signal transduction in neurons
    - Glucose production
    - Vasodilation
5. Inhibited by
    - Gi proteins inhibit Adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP levels
    - cAMP phosphodiesterase dephosphorylates cAMP into AMP, reducing the cAMP
      levels. This is suppressed by caffeine and other PDE inhibitors.
