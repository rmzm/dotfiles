Sensation of itch is carried by mechano-insensitive C-fibers from the upper two
layers of the skin.

Mechanisms can be:
- Dermal: stimulation of those C-fibers by histamine
- Neuropathic: disturbance of the afferent pathways
- Neurogenic: release of histamine in the CNS
- Psychogenic: tactile hallucinations, OCD, etc.

Can be caused by: dry skin, wound healing, scar growth, allergic reactions,
inflammation, immune reactions to infestations or insect bites,
irritations (e.g. shaving), opioids, medical disorders
