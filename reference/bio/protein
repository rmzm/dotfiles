5 Klassen: alpha, beta, alpha/beta, alpha+beta, membrane

| Abbreviations: p→protein, TM=transmembrane
| ACh=Acetylcholine, 5HT=Serotonin, NA=Noradrenaline, A=Adrenaline
######## Immune System ########
- Defensin: opens pores in pathogens to let nutrients flow out, affects
  bacteria, fungi and many types of viruses
- CCR5 [C-C chemokine RECP type 5]: membrane P @leukocytes, target of HIV
- Lysozyme: hydrolyzes peptidoglycans in bacteria cell walls @tears @saliva
  @mucus @milk, used to dissolve bacteria to extract content
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme
- θ-Defensin: dormant variant of defensin, would inhibit HIV-1 entry

######## Metabolism ########
- CYP3A4 [Cytochrome P450 3A4]: oxidizes xenobiotics @liver, e.g. bergamottin
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CYP3A4
- Lactase: catalyzes lactose→galactose+glucose
- MAO-A: antidepressant, breaks down alkaloids/monoamines, need to follow diet
| variants cause aggressive behavior ("warrior gene")
- MAO-B: no apparent use, involved in alzheimer's & parkinson's disease
- TIM [Triose-phosphate Isomerase]: doubles efficiency of glycolysis
| cat. DHAP [Dihydroxyacetone phosphate] <-> D3P [D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]
- ATP synthase: Mitochondrial TM protein catalyzing ADP+Pi→ATP
######## Structural ########
- Keratin: constituent of hair/nails/horns/epidermis
- Collagen: fibrous P, main component of connective tissue, 30% of body protein
- Histone: DNA coils around it, forming nucleosomes
- Actin: constituent of microfilaments to move cell, provide transportation
  routes, contract muscles
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actin
- Neurexin: presynaptic adhesion protein, glues synapses together
- Neuroligin: postsynaptic adhesion protein, glues synapses together
######## Signaling ########
- Insulin: promotes absorbtion of glucose into skeletal muscle & fat tissue
    - release triggered by glucose, branched-chain AAs (leucine, arginine)
    - produced by beta cells @pancreas
    - inhibits production of glucose @liver
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin
- Enkephalin: class of endorphins: Tyr-Gly-Gly-Phe-{Met,Leu}, δ-opioid agonists
- Cytokine: Category of P important in cell signaling
- AChE [Acetylcholinesterase]: enzyme hydrolyzing ACh in neuromuscular
  junctions & cholinergic synapses
- VMAT [Vesicular Monoamine Transporter]: VMAT1 @neuroendocrine, VMAT2 @CNS/PNS
- Synapsin: regulates number of synaptic vesicles used in exocytosis
- Klotho: TM protein involved in aging & sensitivity to insulin
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klotho_(biology)
| https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetylcholinesterase
######## Reproduction ########
DNA ligase: forms covalent bonds to close sugar-phosphate bonds in DNA
######## Plumbing ########
- Telomerase: adds TTAGGG to 3' end of DNA, junk data protecting it
- Transposase: cuts&pastes movable DNA sequences ("transposons") elsewhere
- Superoxide Dismutase: antioxidants most effective against superoxide
    - SOD1: soluble
    - SOD2: mitochondrial
    - SOD3: extracellular
- PKA [Protein Kinase A]: diverse family, activated by cAMP
- Porin: beta-barrel TM, mitochondrial/bacterial, molecules diffuse through
- Nuclease: breaks phosphodiester bonds between nucleotides @ nucleic acids
- Hemoglobin: iron/oxygen-binding P in blood
- Neuroglobin: iron/oxygen-binding P in nervous system
- Myoglobin: iron/oxygen-binding protein in muscle tissue
- Na+/K+-ATPase: "Sodium-Potassium Pump", moves 2K+ in, 3Na+ out of cell
  to help maintaining -70mV resting potential, using 1ATP
- Myosin: pulls on actin to contract muscles
- Dynein: motor P transporting vesicles along microtubules, consuming ATP
| walks towards the minus-end of the microtubule
######## Non-human ########
- TAL: binds to DNA sequences to activate|repress transcription
| aka Transcription activator-like effector
| naturally secreted by plant pathogen Xanthomonas, binds to genes in
| rice/tomatos/etc, activating genes that aid in bacterial infection
| The plants evolved defenses by having other genes similar to the targets
- RuBisCO: adds CO2 to Ribulose 1,5-biphosphate, 1st step of carbon fixation
  The most plentiful protein on earth, 50% of soluble leaf protein in C3 plants
