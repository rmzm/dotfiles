P.132: serotonergic & dopaminergic hallucinations seem to have different
mechanisms.  High number of serotonin receptors in dorsal parietal lobe &
posterior thalamus (regions that encompass the posterior hubs of the dorsal
attention network).  Serotonergic hallucinations relate to objects and their
relation to peri-personal space and involve warping of perceptual scenery or
the breakdown of normal veridical color schemes with inter-object
relationships.
